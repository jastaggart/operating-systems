# Operating Systems - ECSE 427

This repository contains 3 assignments completed during the ECSE 427 course:
  - Shell: A shell program that contains basic shell commands, such as `ls`, `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `fg`, `jobs`, `exit`. It also handles output redirection and command piping.
  - Thread-Scheduler: A first-come first-served thread scheduler with two executors, one for compute tasks and one for IO tasks. These are both kernel-level threads, and they run the tasks on user-level threads.
  - File-System: A simple file system that includes several file actions, such as creating, opening, reading from, writing to, seeking, and deleting a file. The file system is implemented using a super block, i-node table, data blocks, and free bitmap on disk, as well as directory table and i-node cache in memory.
